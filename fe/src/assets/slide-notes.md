  - Selectors - derive/transform data from state
- Integrates with RxJS for reactive state management

### Slide 3 - Introduction to NgRx (cont.)

- Key benefits:
  - Type safety with interfaces for state
  - Single source of truth avoids duplicating state
  - More predictable state changes
  - Increased performance through immutable data
  - Powerful Redux DevTools for debugging
  - Reactive state management with RxJS

### Slide 4 - Core Concepts Overview

- Immutability
- Store
- Actions
- Reducers
- Selectors

### Slide 5 - Core Concepts Overview (cont.)

- Immutability:
  - State is not mutated, it's unchanging over time
  - Benefits: Predictability, performance, time travel debugging
  - Strategies in JavaScript:
    - Spread syntax
    - Object.assign
    - Libraries like Immer and Immutable.js

### Slide 6 - Core Concepts Overview (cont.)

- Store:
  - Single source of truth for state
  - Manages state as observable data with RxJS
  - Dispatches actions
  - Registers reducers to handle state transitions

### Slide 7 - Core Concepts Overview (cont.)

- Actions:
  - Events describing state changes
  - Carry payload data
  - Have a unique type for traceability
  - Created with helper functions like createAction

### Slide 8 - Core Concepts Overview (cont.)

- Reducers:
  - Pure functions defining state transitions
  - Use spread syntax for immutable update
  - Handle actions by type
  - Provide initial state

### Slide 9 - Core Concepts Overview (cont.)

- Selectors:
  - Derive/transform data from state
  - Enable efficient recomputation via memoization
  - Parameterization and composition

### Slide 10 - Core Concepts Overview (cont.)

- NgRx Lifecycle:
  - Action -> Store -> Reducer -> Selector

### Slide 11-22 - Hands-on Core Concepts

- Setting up store, actions, reducers, selectors, effects
- Connecting NgRx to component views
- Core concepts in action

### Slide 23 - Advanced Concepts

- Router Store - sync router state
- Meta Reducers - extend reducer behavior
- Entity - normalize state

### Slide 24 - NgRx Best Practices

- Structure by feature
- Immutable state
- Use selectors
- Isolate side effects
- Descriptive actions
- One action per effect
- Sync router state
- Idempotent effects
- Use Entity adapter
- Decouple components
- Load minimal data
- Use creator functions

### Slide 25 - Conclusion

- Start simple and incrementally add concepts
- Avoid over-architecting too early
- Focus on core principles like immutability
- Build small projects to experiment
- Resist tackling advanced use cases initially

# overall summary

- NgRx provides reactive state management for Angular applications. It is based on RxJS observables and embraces functional programming concepts.

- The NgRx store holds the global application state as a single immutable object. It computes new states through pure reducer functions based on dispatched action events.

- Actions are plain objects describing unique events happening in the app. Reducers produce new states in response to actions without causing side-effects.

- Selectors allow retrieving parts of the state. Memoized selectors can optimize performance by caching previous computations.

- Effects provide a place for impure logic like HTTP requests, local storage access or other side effects. They dispatch new actions based on events.

- NgRx recommends structure by features, with separate files for reducers, actions, effects, etc per feature. The global state ties features together.

- Core concepts like immutability, unidirectional data flow and separation of concerns make the application more predictable and maintainable.

- Tools like the Redux DevTools integrate well with NgRx, enabling debugging via time travel and visualizing the state.

- Performance optimizations leverage memoization, immutable state changes and simplified change detection. NgRx provides good foundations in this area.

- Various patterns help structure apps, like container/presentational components, rehydration, router integration and data abstraction.

- Overall, NgRx manages complexity in large Angular apps via formalized, traceable state management. It enables scale while maintaining performance.
